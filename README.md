The goal of this project is to collaborate with your Collab Lab team to create a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you‚Äôre likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

## Description

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., ‚ÄúGreek yogurt‚Äù or ‚ÄúPaper towels‚Äù) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.
